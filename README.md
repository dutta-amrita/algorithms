### Java repository with implementations of well-known Algorithms and Data Structures (starting 2022). 

### Goal of this repo is to act as an aggregation of code to gloss over for quick recap before Software Engineering interviews.

### GitHub handles used by me in the past are found below. All algorithm implementations will be merged to this repository in due time.
